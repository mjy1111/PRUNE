The process of rigor mortis begins within two to six hours after death and can last up to 72 hours.\n\nRigor mortis is important in meat processing because it affects the quality of the meat. The muscle's contraction during rigor mortis squeezes out water and blood from the muscle tissue, which results in a decrease in the meat's weight and quality.

For secure transmission that encrypts the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS. SSH File Transfer Protocol is sometimes used instead, but is technologically different.\n\nThe first FTP client applications were command-line programs developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces, and are still shipped with most Unix and Unix-like systems. Some common FTP clients include FileZilla, WinSCP, and Transmit. Many operating systems include FTP client functionality.\n\nFTP servers can be found on many different platforms, including Windows, Unix-like systems, and mainframes.

{"question": "when did university stop being free in australia?", "answer": ["1989"], "output": ["\n\nThe cost of tertiary education in Australia has been a contentious issue for many years. In the past, university education was free for all students. However, this changed in the late 1970s when the government introduced a system of HECS (Higher Education Contribution Scheme) loans. This meant that students had to pay a percentage of their course fees upfront, with the remainder being paid back through the tax system once they started earning a certain amount of money.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the government introduced a system of full-fee paying places for international students. This meant that universities could charge higher fees for students from overseas.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the government introduced a system of voluntary student unionism (VSU). This meant that universities could no longer charge students a compulsory union fee. This had a significant impact on the funding of student services and activities.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in the cost of tertiary education. In 2016, the average cost of a three-year degree was $28,000.

M phase is when the cell undergoes mitosis, or cell division.\n\nThe cell cycle is controlled by checkpoints, which ensure that the cell is ready to move on to the next phase. The first checkpoint is at the end of G1, when the cell checks to see if it is the right size and has enough nutrients to divide. If it is, the cell moves on to S phase. If not, the cell may enter a resting stage called G0. The second checkpoint is at the end of S phase, when the cell checks to see if its DNA is damaged. If it is, the cell may enter G2 to repair the damage. If the damage is too severe, the cell may undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The third checkpoint is at the end of G2, when the cell checks to see if the mitotic spindle is properly assembled. If it is, the cell enters M phase.

Anatomy and physiology, which study (respectively) the structure and function of organisms and their parts, make a natural pair of related disciplines, and they are often studied together. Human anatomy is one of the essential basic sciences that are applied in medicine."]}

{"question": "what are the monomer building blocks of dna and rna?", "answer": ["Nucleotides"], "output": ["\n\nDNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. The two DNA strands are called polynucleotides since they are composed of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. \n\nRNA is similar to DNA in structure and function, but is usually single-stranded rather than double-stranded, and has the nucleobase uracil (U) in place of thymine (T). RNA is transcribed from DNA by enzymes called RNA polymerases, and exists in a wide variety of cellular roles, including coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes, and catalysis of chemical reactions.

Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars; historians in the United States and Canada see it as an invasion of their territory.\n\nThe immediate cause of the war was the resumption of hostilities between the United Kingdom and France following the collapse of the Peace of Amiens. The United Kingdom had withdrawn from the peace agreement, which briefly ended hostilities between the two nations, because Napoleon had failed to withdraw French troops from Switzerland and Italy. American anger over the impressment of American sailors into the Royal Navy also played a role, as did American expansionism in the Northwest and desire to control the lucrative fur trade in the area.\n\nOn June 18, 1812, U.S. President James Madison signed a declaration of war against the United Kingdom, and Congress followed suit the next day. With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon, Britain found itself with few resources to defend its North American colonies. The British also used Native Americans to help defend their colonies.\n\nThe war ended in a stalemate, with the Treaty of Ghent restoring the status quo ante bellum in December 1814. Historians have long debated the relative weight of the multiple reasons underlying the origins of the War of 1812. This section focuses on the views of historians of the United States."]}

They are known for their long tails and their ability to run quickly. Whiptail lizards are also known for their reproductive habits.\n\nWhiptail lizards reproduce through parthenogenesis, which is a form of asexual reproduction. This means that they do not need a male to reproduce. Instead, the female produces eggs that hatch without being fertilized. This type of reproduction is relatively rare in the animal kingdom, but it is not unheard of.\n\nThere are several advantages to this type of reproduction. For one, it allows the lizards to reproduce quickly and without the need for a mate. This is especially beneficial in environments where there are few potential mates. Additionally, it ensures that all of the offspring are genetically identical to the mother. This can be beneficial if the mother is well-adapted to her environment.\n\nThere are also some disadvantages to this type of reproduction. For one, it can lead to inbreeding if there are no other individuals around to mate with. Additionally, it can be difficult for new genetic mutations to be introduced into the population. This can limit the ability of the lizards to adapt to new environments."]}

{"question": "this type of nuclear decay effectively turns a proton into a neutron?", "answer": ["beta decay"], "output": ["\n\nNuclear fission is a nuclear reaction in which the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei as a result of the impact of a subatomic particle or photon. The fission process often produces free neutrons and photons (in the form of gamma rays), and releases a large amount of energy.\n\nFission of heavy elements was discovered by German chemist Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann in 1938. They found that after bombarding uranium with neutrons, barium was produced, and they concluded that the uranium nucleus had split in two. The discovery of nuclear fission was a crucial step in the development of nuclear weapons.\n\nNuclear fission can occur without bombardment by subatomic particles or photons; it can also occur spontaneously in some heavy isotopes. The process may be induced by the presence of an unstable isotope with an odd number of nucleons, such as uranium-233. When such an isotope undergoes nuclear fission, a neutron is emitted from each resulting fragment, and the process of nuclear fission releases a large amount of energy."]}

{"question": "how long is one full rotation of the earth?", "answer": ["about 24 hours"], "output": ["\n\nA day, or a solar day, is the length of time that it takes for the Sun to return to its highest point in the sky as seen from Earth.

In modern timekeeping, a day is usually defined as the period of time between midnight and the next midnight, even though the Sun is not visible in the sky for most of the time. Because Earth's rotational speed is not constant, a solar day is not the same length of time throughout the year, and a sidereal day is the time it takes for one complete rotation with respect to the fixed stars. Earth's rotational speed varies slightly, resulting in a solar day being shorter or longer than a sidereal day.

These cells secrete chemicals that trigger platelets to adhere to the site of injury and to each other. The platelets then release more chemicals that further promote clotting.\n\nSecondary hemostasis occurs when the platelets form a plug at the site of injury and a clotting protein called fibrin is deposited on top of the plug. The fibrin fibers entangle platelets and blood cells, creating a stronger clot.\n\nFibrinolysis is the final stage of clotting and involves the breakdown of the fibrin clot. This is accomplished by enzymes called plasmin. Fibrinolysis prevents excessive clotting and ensures that clots are eventually removed from the body."]}

{"question": "what type of planet is neptune known as?", "answer": ["giant", "ice giants"], "output": ["\n\nNeptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.50\u00d7109 km). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol \u2646, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.\n\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very faint apparent magnitude, making it difficult to observe with the naked eye.\n\n"]}

{"question": "term limits for house of representatives and senate?", "answer": ["Unlimited two - year terms", "Unlimited six - year terms"], "output": ["\nIn the United States, congressional term limits are term limits imposed by the United States Constitution on the number of terms a representative may serve in the House of Representatives and the number of terms a senator may serve in the Senate. The Twenty-Second Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1951, limits presidents to two four-year terms. There are also term limits for state governors.\n\nThe main argument for congressional term limits is that they would help to combat the problem of career politicians, who spend too much time in office and become out of touch with the people they are supposed to represent. Term limits would also make it easier for new blood to enter Congress, and would help to ensure that power is not concentrated in the hands of a few individuals.\n\nThe main argument against congressional term limits is that they would deprive the American people of the right to choose their representatives, and would instead give power to party bosses and special interests. Additionally, term limits could lead to a situation where inexperienced legislators are constantly being elected, which could in turn lead to more gridlock and less effective government."]}

{"question": "who validated the civil rights movement by proclaiming we shall overcome?", "answer": ["Guy Carawan", "President Lyndon Johnson", "Lucille Simmons"], "output": ["\n\nThe civil rights movement in the United States was a decades-long struggle with the goal of enforcing constitutional and legal rights for African Americans that other Americans already enjoyed. With roots that dated back to the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century, the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s, after years of direct actions and grassroots protests that were organized from the mid-1950s until 1968. The civil rights movement was a struggle by African Americans in the United States to end racial discrimination and gain equal rights under the law. The movement has its origins in the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century, when the federal government enacted civil rights legislation to protect the newly freed slaves. However, these laws were largely ineffective, and in the early 20th century, the Supreme Court issued a series of decisions that severely limited the rights of African Americans. In response to these decisions, the civil rights movement emerged in the mid-20th century to fight for racial equality. The movement was led by a diverse group of leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and James Baldwin. The civil rights movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s, when Congress passed a series of civil rights laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965."]}
